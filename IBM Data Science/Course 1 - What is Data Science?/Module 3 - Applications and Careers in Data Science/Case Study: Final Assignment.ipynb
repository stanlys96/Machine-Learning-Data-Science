    "\n",
    "Lila's Approach to Working on Her First Task as a Data Scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "As a newly hired junior data scientist at a retail company, Lila uses data insights to improve customer service. Her first assignment involves diving into customer data to identify patterns and anomalies that could impact customer service. She uses data analysis to enhance the overall customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Selection and Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial phase of her data science journey, Lila faced the challenge of selecting a suitable dataset and procuring it from different sources. Apart from the historical data available for the organizations for the past four years, she scoured various repositories, websites, and databases to find the right datasets for her project. Upon collecting data from diverse sources, Lila encountered another crucial decision point. She had to decide how to harmonize and integrate these disparate datasets into a cohesive whole. She reached out to product professionals, data engineers, and domain specialists, seeking their input and expertise in merging datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Understanding and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Lila begins by importing the dataset into her data analysis environment using Python and SQL. She loads the data and examines the first few rows to understand its structure and contents. Upon acquiring the dataset, Lila encounters her first challenge: data cleaning. Lila checks for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset. She addresses missing data by imputing or removing rows or columns with missing values. Outliers are identified and treated appropriately based on their impact on the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "As she delves into exploratory data analysis, Lila faces numerous choices. She must determine which summary statistics, visualizations, and distribution analyses will best reveal insights into customer behavior and sales trends. Each choice she makes during EDA influences the story the data will tell. Lila conducts EDA to gain insights into the dataset. She generates summary statistics and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) and explores the distribution of variables. EDA helps her understand customer behavior, popular products, and sales trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
