    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should select a language to learn depending on your needs, the problems you are trying to solve, and whom you are solving them for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The popular languages are Python, R, SQL, Scala, Java, C++, and Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For data science, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python can also be used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is open source, and R is free software. \n",
    "\n",
    "- R languageâ€™s array-oriented syntax makes it easier to translate from math to code for learners with no or minimal programming background.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL is different from other software development languages because it is a non-procedural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQL was designed for managing data in relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you learn SQL and use it with one database, you can apply your SQL knowledge with many other databases easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data science tools built with Java include Weka, Java-ML, Apache MLlib, and Deeplearning4.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For data science, popular program built with Scala is Apache Spark which includes Shark, MLlib, GraphX, and Spark Streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programs built for Data Science with JavaScript include TensorFlow.js and R-js.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One great application of Julia for Data Science is JuliaDB."
