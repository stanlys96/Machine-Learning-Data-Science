<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Binary classification model</strong></td>
<td>A model that classifies data into two categories, such as yes/no or stop/go outcomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Data compilation</strong></td>
<td>The process of gathering and organizing data required for modeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Data modeling</strong></td>
<td>The stage in the data science methodology where data scientists develop models, either descriptive or predictive, to answer specific questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Descriptive model</strong></td>
<td>A type of model that examines relationships between variables and makes inferences based on observed patterns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Diagnostic measure based tuning</strong></td>
<td>The process of fine-tuning the model by adjusting parameters based on diagnostic measures and performance indicators.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Diagnostic measures</strong></td>
<td>The evaluation of a model's performance of a model to ensure that the model functions as intended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Discrimination criterion</strong></td>
<td>A measure used to evaluate the performance of the model in classifying different outcomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>False-positive rate</strong></td>
<td>The rate at which the model incorrectly identifies negative outcomes as positive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Histogram</strong></td>
<td>A graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset, where the data is divided into intervals or bins, and the height of each bar represents the frequency or count of data points falling within that interval.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Maximum separation</strong></td>
<td>The point where the ROC curve provides the best discrimination between true-positive and false-positive rates, indicating the most effective model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Model evaluation</strong></td>
<td>The process of assessing the quality and relevance of the model before deployment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Optimal model</strong></td>
<td>The model that provides the maximum separation between the ROC curve and the baseline, indicating higher accuracy and effectiveness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)</strong></td>
<td>Originally developed for military radar, the military used this statistical curve to assess the performance of binary classification models.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Relative misclassification cost</strong></td>
<td>This measurement is a parameter in model building used to tune the trade-off between true-positive and false-positive rates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve)</strong></td>
<td>A diagnostic tool used to determine the optimal classification model's performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Separation</strong></td>
<td>Separation is the degree of discrimination achieved by the model in correctly classifying outcomes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Statistical significance testing</strong></td>
<td>Evaluation technique to verify that data is appropriately handled and interpreted within the model.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>True-positive rate</strong></td>
<td>The rate at which the model correctly identifies positive outcomes.</td>
</tr>
