    "Module 1 Summary: Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python can distinguish among data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floats are numbers that have decimal points; they can represent whole or fractional values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can convert integers to floats using typecasting and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can convert integers and floats to strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can convert an integer or float to a Boolean: 0 becomes False, non-zero becomes True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expressions in Python are a combination of values and operations used to produce a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expressions perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use // to perform integer division, which results in an integer value by discarding the fractional part.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python follows the order of operations (BODMAS) to perform operations with multiple expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables store and manipulate data, allowing you to access and modify values throughout your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assignment operator \"=\" assigns a value to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assigning another value to the same variable overrides the previous value of that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can perform mathematical operations on variables using the same or different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modifying the value of one variable will affect other variables only if they reference the same mutable object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python string operations involve manipulating text data using tasks such as indexing, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A string is usually written within double quotes or single quotes, including letters, white space, digits, or special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A string can be assigned to a variable and is an ordered sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Characters in a string identify their index numbers, which can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings are sequences that support operations like indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can input a stride value to perform slicing while operating on a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations like concatenation and replication produce new strings, while finding the length of a string returns a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot modify an existing string; they are immutable. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use escape sequences with a backslash (\\) to change the layout of a string.  (For example, \\n for a new line, \\t for a tab, and \\\\ for a backslash, etc.)   \n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, you perform tasks such as searching, modifying, and formatting text data with its pre-built string methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You apply a method to a string to change its value, resulting in another string. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can perform actions such as changing the case of characters in a string, replacing items in a string, finding items in a string, and so on using pre-built string methods."
