<td>Aliasing refers to giving another name to a function or a variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ampersand</td>
<td>A character typically "&amp;" standing for the word "and."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Compound elements</td>
<td>Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delimiter</td>
<td>A delimiter in Python is a character or sequence of characters used to separate or mark the boundaries between elements or fields within a larger data structure, such as a string or a file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dictionaries</td>
<td>A dictionary in Python is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a specific value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Function</td>
<td>A function is a block of code, defining a set procedure, which is executed only when it is called.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Immutable</td>
<td>Immutable Objects are of in-built datatypes like int, float, bool, string, Unicode, and tuple. In simple words, an immutable object can't be changed after it is created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intersection</td>
<td>The intersection of two sets is a new set containing only the elements that are present in both sets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Keys</td>
<td>The keys () method in Python Dictionary, returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary in order of insertion using Python.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lists</td>
<td>A list is any list of data items, separated by commas, inside square brackets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logic operations</td>
<td>In Python, logic operations refer to the use of logical operators such as "and," "or," and "not" to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mutable</td>
<td>Mutable objects in Python are objects whose values can be changed after they are created. These objects allow modifications such as adding, removing, or altering elements without creating a new object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nesting</td>
<td>A nested function is simply a function within another function and is sometimes called an "inner function".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ratings in python</td>
<td>Ratings in Python typically refer to a numerical or qualitative measure assigned to something to indicate its quality, performance, or value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Set operations</td>
<td>Set operations in Python refer to mathematical operations performed on sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sets in python</td>
<td>A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Syntax</td>
<td>The rules that define the structure of the language for python is called its syntax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tuples</td>
<td>These are used store multiple items in a single variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type casting</td>
<td>In python, this is converting one data type to another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Variables</td>
<td>In python, a variable is a symbolic name or identifier used to store and manipulate data. Variables serve as containers for values, and these values can be of various data types, including numbers, strings, lists, and more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Venn diagram</td>
<td>A Venn diagram is a graphical representation that uses overlapping circles to illustrate the relationships and commonalities between sets or groups of items.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Versatile data</td>
<td>Versatile data, in a general context, refers to data that can be used in multiple ways, is adaptable to different applications or purposes, and is not restricted to a specific use case.</td>
