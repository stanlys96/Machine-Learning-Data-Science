<tbody><tr>
<td>.csv file</td>
<td>A .csv (Comma-Separated Values) file is a plain text file format for storing tabular data, where each line represents a row and uses commas to separate values in different columns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.txt file</td>
<td>A .txt (Text) file is a common file format that contains plain text without specific formatting, making it suitable for storing and editing textual data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Append</td>
<td>To "append" means to add or attach something to the end of an existing object, typically used in the context of adding data to a file or elements to a data structure like a list in Python.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Attribute</td>
<td>An "attribute" in Python refers to a property or characteristic associated with an object, which can be accessed using dot notation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Broadcasting in NumPy</td>
<td>Broadcasting in NumPy allows arrays with different shapes to be combined in element-wise operations by automatically extending smaller arrays to match the shape of larger ones, making operations more flexible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Component</td>
<td>In NumPy, a "component" typically refers to a specific element or value within a multi-dimensional array, which can be accessed using indexing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Computation</td>
<td>Computation in NumPy involves performing numerical operations on arrays and matrices, making it a powerful library for mathematical and scientific computing in Python.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data analysis</td>
<td>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DataFrames</td>
<td>A DataFrames in Pandas is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure for storing and analyzing data, consisting of rows and columns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dependencies</td>
<td>Dependencies in Pandas are external libraries or modules, such as NumPy, that Pandas rely on for fundamental data manipulation and analysis functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File attribute</td>
<td>File attributes generally refer to properties or metadata associated with files, which are managed at the operating system level.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File object</td>
<td>A "file object" in Python represents an open file, allowing reading from or writing to the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grid</td>
<td>In Python, a "grid" typically refers to a two-dimensional structure composed of rows and columns, often used to represent data in a tabular format or for organizing objects in a coordinate system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hadamard Product</td>
<td>The Hadamard product is a mathematical operation that involves element-wise multiplication of two matrices or arrays of the same shape, producing a new matrix with each element being the product of the corresponding elements in the input matrices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Importing pandas</td>
<td>To import Pandas in Python, you use the statement: import pandas as pd, which allows you to access Pandas functions and data structures using the abbreviation "pd."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Index</td>
<td>In Python, an "index" typically refers to a position or identifier used to access elements within a sequence or data structure, such as a list or string.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Libraries</td>
<td>Libraries in Python are collections of pre-written code modules that provide reusable functions and classes to simplify and enhance software development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Linspace</td>
<td>In Python, "linspace" refers to a NumPy function that generates an array of evenly spaced values within a specified range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NumPy</td>
<td>NumPy in Python is a fundamental library for numerical computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a variety of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One dimensional NumPy</td>
<td>A one-dimensional NumPy array is a linear data structure that stores elements in a single sequence, often used for numerical computations and data manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open function</td>
<td>In Python, the "open" function is used to access and manipulate files, allowing you to read from or write to a specified file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pandas</td>
<td>Pandas is a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and tools for working with structured data like tables and time series.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pandas library</td>
<td>Pandas library in Python refer to the various modules and functions within the Pandas library, which provides powerful data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plotting Mathematical Functions</td>
<td>Plotting mathematical functions in Python involves using libraries like Matplotlib to create graphical representations of mathematical equations, aiding visualization, and analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shape</td>
<td>In NumPy, "shape" refers to an array's dimensions (number of rows and columns), describing its size and structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slicing</td>
<td>Slicing in NumPy entails extracting specific portions of an array by specifying a range of indices, enabling you to work with subsets of the data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two dimensional NumPy</td>
<td>A two-dimensional NumPy array is a structured data representation with rows and columns, resembling a matrix or table, ideal for various data manipulation and analysis tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Universal Functions</td>
<td>Universal functions (ufuncs) in NumPy are functions that operate element-wise on arrays, providing efficient and vectorized operations for a wide range of mathematical and logical operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vector addition</td>
<td>Vector addition in Python involves adding corresponding elements of two or more vectors, producing a new vector with the sum of their components.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visualizations</td>
<td>Visualizations in Python refer to the creation of graphical representations, such as charts, plots, and graphs, to illustrate and communicate data and trends visually.</td>
</tr>
