    "Summary: Introduction to Data Visualization Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Data visualization is the process of presenting data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps, to help people understand and analyze data easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Data visualization has diverse use cases, such as in business, science, healthcare, and finance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is important to follow best practices, such as selecting appropriate visualizations for the data being presented, choosing colors and fonts that are easy to read and interpret, and minimizing clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are various types of plots commonly used in data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line plots capture trends and changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar plots compare categories or groups, providing a visual comparison of their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatter plots explore relationships between variables, helping us identify correlations or trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Box plots display the distribution of data, showcasing the median, quartiles, and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histograms illustrate the distribution of data within specific intervals, allowing us to understand its shape and concentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a plotting library that offers a wide range of plotting capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas is a plotting library that provides Integrated plotting functionalities for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seaborn is a specialized library for statistical visualizations, offering attractive default aesthetics and color palettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Folium is a Python library that allows you to create interactive and customizable maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotly is an interactive and dynamic library for data visualization that supports a wide range of plot types and interactive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PyWaffle enables you to visualize proportional representation using squares or rectangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib was initially developed as an EEG/ECoG visualization tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlibâ€™s architecture is composed of three main layers: Backend layer, Artist layer, and the Scripting layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The anatomy of a plot refers to the different components and elements that make up a visual representation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is a well-established data visualization library that can be integrated in different environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib has a number of different backends available. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can easily include the label and title to your plot with plt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to start creating different types of plots of the data, you will need to import the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A line plot is a plot in the form of a series of data points connected by straight line segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Line plot is one of the most basic type of chart and is common in many fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can generate a line plot by assigning \"line\" to 'Kind' parameter in the plot() function."
