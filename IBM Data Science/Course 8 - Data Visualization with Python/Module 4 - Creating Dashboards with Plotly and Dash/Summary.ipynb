    "Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Dash is an Open-Source User Interface Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easy to build Graphical User Interfaces using Dash as it abstracts all technologies required to make the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two components of Dash: Core and HTML components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dash_core_components describe higher-level interactive components generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dash_html_components library has a component for every HTML tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A callback function is a python function that is automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The @app.callback decorator decorates the callback function in order to tell Dash to call it whenever there is a change in the input component value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The callback function takes input and output components as parameters and performs operations to return the desired result for the output component."
