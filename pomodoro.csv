Supervised learning can be further divided into 2 categories, regression and classification. Regression means that the machine learning is trying to predict a number from an infinite possible numbers, while for classification, the machine learning is trying to predict from a finite number of categories or labels. Currently, the machine learning world is dominated by supervised learning.",DeepLearningAI Machine Learning,1,Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification,Coursera,5,1,"""Welcome to machine learning!"", ""Applications of machine learning"", ""What is machine learning?"", ""Supervised learning part 1"", ""Supervised learning part 2"""
