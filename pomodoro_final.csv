           Clustering means that, instead of us giving labels for the algorithm to predict, we just give the dataset and let the algorithm find structures in our data. We don't specify labels, or 'supervise' the algorithm
           hence the name is unsupervised learning. One example can be to find customer clusters in an e-commerce's customer dataset. Anomaly detection is used to detect unusual data, particularly useful in finance industry for fraud detection.
           Dimensionality reduction is about reducing the dimensions of the data and losing as little information as possible. Also learned about linear regression. Linear regression is one of the most basic supervised learning algorithm. It is used to predict number outcomes, such as the price of a house.
